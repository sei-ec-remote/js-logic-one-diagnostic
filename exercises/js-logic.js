=============== JavaScript Logic Challenge I ==================

GOAL: Read each question and write code to complete each task
      given. Do not change starter code or function names.

TEST: To test run the commands `npm run test` in your terminal
      at the root of this directory.(js-logic-one-diagnostic)
      Don't worry about capitalization.

/*
Question 1

Finish the function. Using the number that is passed in, `num`, first find all the numbers that are less than it (`num`) that are multiples of 3 or 5, then return the sum of these numbers. 

Ex: If the number passed in is 10; 3, 5, 6, and 9 are both less than 10 and multiples of 3 or 5. The sum of these numbers are 23

		if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 ===0) {

		}
	}
	return sum;

/*
Question 2

Finish the function. Using the string that is passed in return the number of how many vowels occur.
*/

			counter ++
		}

	// console.log(`The text contains ${counter} vowel(s)`)
	return counter
}

/*
Question 3

Finish the function. Using the string that is passed in return the same string but if a word in that string is longer than 5 word reverse it.

Ex: If the string that is passed in is `hey there person` the return value should be `hey ereht nosrep`
